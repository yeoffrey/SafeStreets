        We believe that every journey should end safely, and every street should
        be a place where people can move freely without fear. Join us in our
        campaign for safer roads, one step at a time.

      <h2>Halton is expected to gain 520,000 more residents by 2051</h2>
      <p>
        These residents will need safe, accessible forms of transportation.
        Widening roads is not an option; it only provides short-term relief and
        can actually increase travel times. What we need to do is give people
        more options for getting around for work, education, and pleasure.

        Unhealthy and expensive, Auto-dependency has impacted our daily lives
      </h2>
      <p>
        15% of Canadians get their recommended daily physical activity, whereas
        people who live in walkable neighbourhoods get about one hour more per
        week, and are 23% less likely to experience stressful days.
      </p>
      <p>
        About 50% of trips in Halton Region are at most a 20-minute bike ride
        away but are taken by car.

      <h2>We can do better</h2>
      <p>
        There are tried-and-true ways to design our streets and roads; A way to
        help drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians stay safe as they travel from A
        to B; A way to promote an active lifestyle. We just need to demand
        better from our region and local councils.
      </p>
      <p>That is why we, Safe Streets Halton, are here.</p>

      <h2>In 2020, there were over 6000 car crashes in Halton</h2>
      <p>
        Of these crashes, 8 were fatal and over 650 resulted in serious injury –
        this can no longer be accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a study conducted by the region, 50% of respondents said they would
        like to walk/bike to work or to visit friends and family. Our streets,
        however, don’t make it safe to do so.
